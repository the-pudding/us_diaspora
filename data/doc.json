It's also the most Mormon country in the world, with more followers of the Church of Latter-Day Saints per capita than any other nation on Earth. Over 60% of the Tongan population belongs to the faith community, which might explain why Salt Lake City, Utah is home to the largest concentration of Tongan immigrants in the United States, according to the 2018 American Community Survey. Mormon missionaries first arrived in Tonga in the 19th century and were granted permission to preach there by then-King George Tupou I. Since then, Mormonism has taken off in the kingdom, and Salt Lake City (where the religious headquarters of the faith are located) has become a destination for US-bound Tongans."}],"country_2_name":"Bulgaria","country_2_id":"bulgaria","country_detail_2":[{"type":"text","value":"The Bulgarian diaspora's roots in Chicagoland are longstanding. In fact, they may date all the way back to the Columbian Exhibition World Fair of 1893, when a famous Bulgarian writer named Aleko Konstantinov visited the city and became so enamored of what he experienced that he used it as material for a new book: Do Chikago i nazad (To Chicago and Back). While economic push factors certainly contributed to several waves of Bulgarian immigrants seeking opportunity in the land of plenty, the legacy of Konstantinov's novel drew them to Chicago in particular. The city was home to the first two Bulgarian bookstores in America, as well as the first Bulgarian newspaper, Struggle. According to the 2019 American Community Survey, it is also home to the largest concentration of foreign-born Bulgarian immigrants in the United States."}],"country_3_name":"Ecuador","country_3_id":"ecuador","country_detail_3":[{"type":"text","value":"In recent years, Ecuadorian immigration to the Queens borough of New York City has become normalized by the numbers. According to the 2018 American Community Survey, Queens is home to the largest concentration of foreign-born Ecuadorians in the United States. But the origins of this journey may surprise you: they begin with the decline of the Panama Hat Industry. Once Ecuador's most coveted export, the Panama Hat (or, as they are known in Ecuador, sombreros de paja toquilla) passed through the bustling ports of Panama before being shipped to twentieth century sartorialists the world over. President Theodore Roosevelt wore them, as did Al Capone. In its heyday, the industry became the major source of international connections for Ecuadorians—so much so that when it began to falter in the face of Chinese competition in xxxx, those same commercial connections supported emigrants to relocate in urban centers around the world. Queens was chief among them."}],"country_4_name":"Greece","country_4_id":"greece","country_detail_4":[{"type":"text","value":"The city of Tarpon Springs, Florida owes its title as Sponge Capital of the World to its foreign-born Greek residents. When they first began arriving on the Gulf shores of this beachside town in the 1890s, bringing with them the particularly Greek method of diving for sponges (rather than harvesting the ancient aquatic creatures with poles), Tarpon Springs' sponge farming industry boomed. In the following decades, so did the town's Greek population as industry leader John Cocoris brought more and more residents from the Dodecanese Islands in Greece. Sponge farming quickly grew to a multimillion dollar industry before faltering in 1947 after a harmful algal bloom decimated the Gulf of Mexico's sponge population. Even so, the diasporic link holds true; according to the 2018 American Community Survey, Tarpon Springs hosts the largest concentration of foreign-born Greeks in the United States."}],"tour":[{"data-previous-step":"usa","data-step":"usa","text":"There are diasporas spread all throughout the US, in cities both large and small."},{"data-previous-step":"usa","data-step":"nyc","text":"But the most geographically dense concentration of diasporas is, by far, New York City."},{"data-previous-step":"nyc","data-step":"nyc-brooklyn","text":"Brooklyn, for example, has a thriving group of ex-Soviet Union communities, including Uzbeks, Ukrainians, and Kazakhs.
